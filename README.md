## Assignment 1
### After writing the script, scroll down to the "Function execution" section and set up a test event to manually invoke the Lambda function. You can create a test event with an empty JSON object {}.

    Click the "Test" button to manually trigger your Lambda function.

    Step 4: Manual Invocation and Testing

    After saving your function, manually trigger it by clicking the "Test" button in the Lambda console.

    Monitor the Lambda function's execution to ensure it runs successfully.

    After the Lambda function execution is complete, go to the EC2 dashboard and confirm that the instances' states have changed according to their tags. The instance tagged as Auto-Stop       should be stopped, and the instance tagged as Auto-Start should be started.
